General folder for Java Resources on Eclipse, can drag into your own Java Dynamic Web Project. The File Subdirectory should look like this:
```
Java Resources
    src/main/java
        (default package)
            JDBCPost.java
            Post.java
```
Just drag the files in this directory into Java Resources and I think they should pop up formatted like that, otherwise idk lmao, try putting them in the default package
