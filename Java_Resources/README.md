General folder for Java Resources on Eclipse, can drag into your own Java Dynamic Web Project. The File Subdirectory should look like this:
```
Java Resources
    src/main/java
        (finalproject)
            JDBCPost.java
            Post.java
```
Just drag the files in this directory into Java Resources and I think they should pop up formatted like that, otherwise idk lmao, try putting them in the default package


IMPORTANT NOTE:
YOU MUST CHANGE THE JDBCPOST CREDENTIALS.

1. SQL Database Table name must be correct (I just use sys, whoever used it last uses finalproject)
2. Username and password must be correct
3. These must be the specs on YOUR OWN local versions of the sql database and username
